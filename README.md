# 1.1 Background
The control of nonlinear dynamic systems is a central challenge in engineering. Among such systems, the inverted pendulum stands as a classic problem, exemplifying the difficulties of controlling inherently unstable systems with nonlinear dynamics. Characterized by its open-loop and closed-loop instability, the inverted pendulum has become a fundamental benchmark in control engineering. It is widely used to test, evaluate, and refine both classical and contemporary control techniques. 

This project aims to demonstrate the modeling and control of a nonlinear inverted pendulum system with the help of MATLAB simulation. By focusing on the development of a dynamic model and the application of control laws, such as the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), this work seeks to provide a comprehensive approach to stabilizing the inverted pendulum system.

# 1.2 Objectives
The goal is to develop a stable inverted pendulum setup by designing a classic PID-controller and a model-based controller to maintain the pendulum in a vertical position around the center of the horizontal transport rail.

### Checklist:
- Model and simulate an inverted pendulum system
- Design and develop an inverted pendulum system
